I have problem reloading the level. First I just reloaded the scene, but I get error in Singeleton due to destroyed objects, so I desided it is better to make a cleanup of the existing scene.
I would epose hardcoded paremeters for tweeking.
I would use object pool for instantiated objects. 
I would fix the player bouncing of the walls. 
I would refactor GameController into multiple classes.
I would adapt the game different aspect ratios.
I would use a event system.
I would not load menu scene every time I go to the menu.
